# GTPN-Project

**Problem:** Many Himalayan businesses lack the opportunities to advertise their products to the general public. In an internet-dominant market, this puts Himalayan businesses at a severe disadvantage compared to their competitors, as they are shorting themselves of multiple avenues of revenue. 

**Idea:** Create a singular platform where Himalayan businesses are able to showcase their products. This is mostly limited to fashion and merchandise. 

**Data Collection:** We plan on creating a bot that web-scrapes a platform like Google or LinkedIn using keywords like “Himalayan business.” From there, the bot would insert the links to the websites on a Doc, where we would then insert the information on these businesses into our platform.
